# Readings: Debugging

**What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.**

- Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

A syntax error occurs due to fault in the program syntax. A logical error occurs due to a fault in the algorithm
- List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

Hundereds of spelling errors that broke my javascript. The litany of logical errors caused by undefined variables.
- How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

The better we are at debugging the more streamlined our code becomes.

**The JavaScript Debugger.**

- How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?


In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code. At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code.
- Define what a breakpoint is.

When a programmer creates code they can add what is known as a breakpoint. A breakpoint is a point in the program where the code will stop executing. 
- What is the call stack?

A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

## Things I want to know more about.

## Readings: HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model
This will help by added more to our ability allowing us to have better control over our sites and expanding the possibilities.

**Learn HTML. Ordered and Unordered lists.**

- When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

 it's used to create a list of related items, in no particular order.
- How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

 use CSS property list-style-type
- When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

Used to create a list of related items, in no particular order. Ordered list — Used to create a list of related items, in a specific order.
- Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

Adding a ol tag?

**Learn CSS. The Box Model.**

- Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

"The Box Model" Margin our exroverted character. Always protecting the element by keeping outside elements away. Sometimes far, sometimes close, but always away. Padding is an introverted sort. Equally as important, for they keep the element safe and surrounded interally. Able to position them anywhere within Margin's borders.
- List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge.

**Learn JS. Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.**

- What data types can you store inside of an Array?

Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays.
- Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

Yes. It is valid. It can be accessed like people[x][y]. Where x = the index of the first array, and y = index of an array that x returned.
- List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

Assignment	x = f() Addition assignment	x += f()	 Subtraction assignment	x -= f()	 Multiplication assignment	x *= f()	 Division assignment	x /= f()	
- Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

I believe it would print '10dog'. Because 10, and dog are able to be combined, but 'false' is not.

 let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

function wierdProb(a,b,c) {
  return ((a + c) + b)

}

var result = wierdProb.call(this,a ,b , c);

console.log(result);

The answer is 10dog I checked.
- Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

Allowing a certain time be reached before turning on an alarm.
- Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.

To keep functions running until a variable is met?

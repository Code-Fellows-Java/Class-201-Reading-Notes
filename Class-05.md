# Readings: Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

**JavaScript Object Basics** 

- How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects.
- What are some advantages to creating object literals?

they are used by many plugins such as jQuery so people are familier and they are easy to read.
- How do objects differ from arrays?

Objects represent a special data type that is mutable and can be used to store a collection of data (rather than just a single value). Arrays are a special type of variable that is also mutable and can also be used to store a list of values.
- Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

You would use it when you want less limitations with the variables you are accessing.
- Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

The dog variable. Being able to quickly access and changes identifiers without chaging the global variable.

**Introduction To The DOM**

- What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. This guide will introduce the DOM, look at how the DOM represents an HTML document in memory and how to use APIs to create web content and applications.
- Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites. JavaScript can also be used in other contexts. For example, Node. js runs JavaScript programs on a computer, but provides a different set of APIs, and the DOM API is not a core part of the Node.

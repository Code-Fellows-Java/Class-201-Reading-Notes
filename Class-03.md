# Readings: HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

Hyperlinks, Flow, and Function invocations are all important to our studies becaue all of them will help enhance and clean up our code. 
Adding urls to our pages and having a smooth flow through our webpage will help greatly with ease of access.

**Learn HTML. Creating Hyperlinks**

- To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content, see Block level links, inside an <a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.
- The href attribute contains what information?
  
  For <a> and <area> elements, the href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. For <base> elements, the href attribute specifies the base URL for all relative URLs on a page. For <link> elements, the href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource (most often a style sheet file).
- What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
  
  Link texts?
**CSS Layout. CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning**

- What is meant by “normal flow”?

How a web Page organically moves throught the Elements.
- What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element
- ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

Static
- Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

Some of the benefits of using absolutely positioned elements in your layouts include: Aside from a few IE bugs, very good cross-browser support. Less dependence on floats, which can be problematic. Less dependence on margins, which can be a bit buggy in older IE.
- What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

Absolutely positioned elements are positioned with respect to a containing block, which is the nearest postioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, the viewport will be the containing block. Elements with fixed positioning are fixed with respect to the viewport—the viewport is always their containing block.

**Learn JS. Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code**

- Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

The main difference between a function expression and a function declaration is the function name, which can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions. A function expression can be used as an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) which runs as soon as it is defined.
- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

The values that are declared within a function when the function is called are known as an argument. Whereas, the variables that are defined when the function is declared are known as a parameter.

**Miscellaneous. 6 Reasons for Pair Programming**

- Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

Engaged collaboration. I had alot of fun communicating with my fellow students and seeing there process. It added a social aspect i didnt anticipate in this line of work.

If it wasn't for Julian Barker today i would not have been able to accomplish the task at hand so Learning from others is definitely next on my list. It is really nice to be able to reach out and get help from a peer.

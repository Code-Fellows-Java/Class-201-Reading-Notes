# Readings: Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

**Domain Modeling**

- Explain why we need domain modeling.

A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

**HTML Table Basics**

- Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

Tables shouldn't be used for page layouts because they are: Slow to render as the browser needs to download most - if not all - of the table to render it properly. They require more HTML than non-table layouts which means slower loading and rendering, as well as an increased bandwidth usage.
- List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table

The section element defines a section in a document. The article element specifies independent, self-contained content. The header element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.


  
 **Introducing Constructors**
  
  - What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

A constructor is a function that creates an instance of a class which is typically called an “object”. In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when you declare an object using the new keyword. The purpose of a constructor is to create an object and set values if there are any object properties present.
  - How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

The main difference here is what you can do with it. With the constructor function notation you create an object that can be instantiated into multiple instances (with the new keyword), while the literal notation delivers a single object, like a singleton.
  
 **Object Prototypes Using A Constructor**
  
  - Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

When I was being trained in the militery I was learning from an already established instructor. So by the emd of the lessons I inherited what they had already learned and made it my own. Becoming my own specialized version of the elements given to me by the instructor.

# Readings: Forms and JS Events

**HTML Forms. Your first Web Form. How To Structure A Web Form.**

- Why are forms so important in web development?

A web form often acts as a communication bridge that allows a user to communicate with a company and vice versa. Illogical and inappropriate questions can hamper the company image quite easily. For example, you want the users to create an account with your website.
- When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

Order the Form Logically and Only Ask Whatâ€™s Required. Present Fields in a Single Column Layout.
- List 5 form elements and explain their importance.


The input element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.

The label element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.

The select element defines a drop-down list

The textarea element defines a multi-line input field (a text area)

The button element defines a clickable button
**Learn JS. Introduction To Events.**

- How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page. When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.
- When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

The addEventListener() is an inbuilt function in JavaScript which takes the event to listen for, and a second argument to be called whenever the described event gets fired. Any number of event handlers can be added to a single element without overwriting existing event handlers.
- Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

Because it is the target property?
- What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

Event capturing means propagation of event is done from ancestor elements to child element in the DOM while event bubbling means propagation is done from child element to ancestor elements in the DOM.
